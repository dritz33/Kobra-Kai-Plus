Welcome to my journey to attempt and upgrade the Kobra Plus firmware to later versions of Marlin.

Trying to match up the code with the Marlin 2.0.0 release currently. 

Have the core folder code copied over and it is still compiling. Testing a print with this firmware and then will get more folders ported over in the future :)

To do:

Finish updating Kobra Plus firmware to Marlin 2.0.0.
Update Kobra Plus firmware to future versions of Marlin, eventually getting to 2.1.0 or 2.1.x bugfix versions.
